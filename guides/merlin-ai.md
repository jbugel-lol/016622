### Preparations

To explore this concept, you will need the following:

1. A base or main account (the account to which the increased query limit will be applied).
2. At least two Chromium-based web browsers (please note that the extension discussed may not be available for Firefox-based browsers).
3. On your primary browser (the one you use regularly), make sure to install the extension and log in to your base/main account.
4. On a separate Chromium browser, install the extension but refrain from logging in (this browser will be used to execute the exploit and will not maintain a continuous login to any account).

### Let's Explore the Exploit

Now, let's delve into the process of exploiting query limits:

1. In the first browser, navigate to the dashboard of the Merlin app/extension and locate your referral link. Copy this link.
2. In the second browser (with the extension installed but no Merlin account logged in), paste the referral link. This action will direct you to an account creation page with the referral code pre-filled.
3. Use a temporary `@gmail` email address, which can be obtained from a service like [Emailnator](https://www.emailnator.com/). If the service does not initially provide an address, click "Generate New" until one appears, and then click "Go."
4. Create an account using the temporary email address and the provided referral link/code. Be sure to complete the account verification process.
5. Finally, sign in to the extension itself using the account you just created. Your base/main account's query limit should increase. You can check this by returning to the first browser, clicking on the extension, and reviewing the query count.
